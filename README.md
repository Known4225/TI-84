# TI-84
TI-84 Assorted Programs

A few cool things

Highlights:

SIMON - play the classic memory game SIMON (requires image files also be imported and RESETGRA)

SNAKE - play the classic Atari snake (requires RESETGRA

PONG - play the classic pong (requires RESETGRA)

All these games use the native TIBasic language and are thus extremely slow

Primer - Prime number generator (necessary for lots of stuff, run this for a bit before reducing or doing anything with modular arithmetic)

REDUCER - reduces a fraction using prime factorisation

RSA - RSA encryption (but with harsh limits on size of primes because of the remainder function domain (requires FSTMDEMB, BINEMB, ASCIIEMB, MDINVEMB, GDCEMB))

AXIS - 3D wireframe editor

RYEMAN - visualisation of Riemann sums

VECTOR - vectors visualisation (requires CLRPTS, DRAWVEC)

QUADFORM - changes quadratics from factored to vertix to standard form

ASCII - converts characters to ASCII

EUCALG - GDC euclidean algorithm, press enter to activate extended when the normal one finishes

RESETNUM - a personal favorite

RESETALL - a sequel to a classic

FSTMODEXP - fast modular exponentiation, using binary conversion and iteration (no fermat) (requires BINEMB)

MODINV - modular inverses

CHINRETH - chinese remainder theorem

YOUKNIT - unit circle helper (requires REDUCING, SQRTBUST)

CASHING - something I used for counting the money at work

CONVBASE - converts between base 10 and other bases

BSTOINT - turns a bitstring into an integer

DEGRAD - Degrees to radians or radians to degrees (requires REDUCING)

COSLAW - law of cosines

LOWOFSIN - law of sines

INTREF - integral reference

NEWTMETH - Newton's method for finding roots

ARCMARC - like RYEMAN but for arc length (requires RESETGRA)
