# TI-84
TI-84 Assorted Programs

A few cool things
Highlights:
SIMON - play the classic memory game SIMON (requires image files also be imported and RESETGRA)
SNAKE - play the classic Atari snake (requires RESETGRA
PONG - play the classic pong (Requires RESETGRA)
All these games use the native TIBasic language and are thus extremely slow

Primer - Prime number generator (necessary for lots of stuff, run this for a bit before reducing or doing anything with modular arithmetic) \n
REDUCER - reduces a fraction using prime factorisation \n
RSA - RSA encryption (but with harsh limits on size of primes and size of message because of prime limits (Requires FSTMDEMB, BINEMB, ASCIIEMB, MDINVEMB, GDCEMB) \n
AXIS - 3D wireframe editor
RYEMAN - visualisation of Riemann sums
VECTOR - vectors visualisation (requires CLRPTS, DRAWVEC)
QUADFORM - changes quadratics from factored to vertix to standard form
ASCII - converts characters to ASCII
EUCALG - GDC euclidean algorithm, press enter to activate extended when the normal one finishes
RESETNUM - a personal favorite
RESETALL - a sequal to a classic
FSTMODEXP - fast modular exponentiation, using binary conversion and iteration (no fermat) (requires BINEMB)
MODINV - modular inverses
CHINRETH - chinese remainder theorem
YOUKNIT - unit circle helper (requires REDUCING, SQRTBUST)
CASHING - something I used for counting the money at work
CONVBASE - converts between base 10 and other bases
BSTOINT - turns a bitstring into an integer
COSLAW - law of cosines
DEGRAD - Degrees to radians or radians to degrees (requires REDUCING)
INTREF - integral reference
NEWTMETH - Newton's method for finding roots
ARCMARC - like RYEMAN but for arc length (requires RESETGRA)
